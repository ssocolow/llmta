Q1. (15 points): Peanut Butter and Jelly

pbj(n: int) : string is a function that returns a sentence, which is a string composed of a sequence of words. n is a positive, nonzero integer supplied by the user. For each consecutive integer
between 1 and n inclusive, pbj either appends the empty string to its output or a word. A word is
a string that contains the substring “peanutbutter” if n is evenly divisible by 3 or “jelly” if n is
evenly divisible by 5. Each outputted word in the final sentence should be separated by a single space
character. The entire sentence must end with the word “time” and a “.” character. Finally, use
recursion to solve this problem.

Here are the first ten outputs of the program.

$ dotnet run 1
time.
$ dotnet run 2
time.
$ dotnet run 3
peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 4
peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 5
peanutbutter jelly time.
$ dotnet run 6
peanutbutter jelly peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 7
peanutbutter jelly peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 8
peanutbutter jelly peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 9
peanutbutter jelly peanutbutter peanutbutter time.
$ dotnet run 10
peanutbutter jelly peanutbutter peanutbutter jelly time.
