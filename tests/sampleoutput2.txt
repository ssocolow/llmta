Let's focus on the most critical issues identified in your grade report, particularly with your implementation of the `pbj` function for Q1.

Based on the grade report, it seems that the expected behavior for your `pbj` function is not met for inputs that are divisible by both 3 and 5. It appears that your code currently only checks for divisibility by 5.

1. Can you think of a way to modify your `match` expression to include a condition for when `k` is divisible by both 3 and 5?
2. How might you include a check for divisibility by 3 in your recursive function?
3. What will happen in your current implementation if you call `dotnet run 3`? How does this compare to the expected output?
4. The assignment requires the use of recursion, yet the base case only handles when `n` is 1. How can you ensure that the base case correctly handles the scenario when `n` is 0, considering the program should not output anything for the number 0?
5. The output for `dotnet run 4` in the example outputs `peanutbutter time.`, but according to the rules, it shouldn't include "peanutbutter" since 4 is not divisible by 3. Can you review the provided examples and clarify the rules for when "peanutbutter" and "jelly" should be appended?

To help you address these questions, consider the following hints:

- Think about how you can expand the `match` expression or the `if` statement to cover all possible conditions (divisible by 3, divisible by 5, divisible by both 3 and 5, or divisible by neither).
- Reflect on the base case of your recursion and ensure it accurately represents the stopping condition for the recursion.
- Reviewing the expected behavior of the program for different inputs will help you understand the logic errors in your current implementation.
================================

Certainly. Here's a single, specific, and actionable question for the student:

Can you identify and implement a condition in your `match` expression that checks whether `k` is divisible by both 3 and 5, and what should the function return in this particular case?
